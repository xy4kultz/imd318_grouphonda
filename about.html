                        <p>Mr. Soichiro Honda was born in Hamamatsu, in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan, in 1906. His father owned a blacksmith’s shop and repaired bicycles as a side-line.
                        As a teenager, Soichiro Honda was apprenticed to a car repair shop in Tokyo, but business was slack as there were few cars in the city at that time.
                        However, this changed after the devastation of the 1923 earthquake. The Japanese government decided to invest in mechanised mass transit.
                        To his luck, Mr. Honda found his services in heavy demand.</p>
